# LearnPythonFromScratch
My Scripts from e.g. Codeacademy and others (some self- developed some probably under copyright) to learn coding in Python
This a database I use to fetch and push my scripts on differetn machine and with different IDEs.
Note that almost everything I am uploading and documenting in here is maybe not of great interest for other developers :P

Good tutorialas can be read at : https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html
